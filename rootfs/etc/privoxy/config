# fun playing buzzword bingo with web pages.

# Privoxy currently doesn't pipeline outgoing requests, thus allowing pipelining on the client connection
# is not guaranteed to improve the performance.
# 
# By default Privoxy tries to discourage clients from pipelining by discarding aggressively pipelined 
# requests, which forces the client to resend them through a new connection.
# 
# This option lets Privoxy tolerate pipelining. Whether or not that improves performance mainly depends on
# the client configuration.
# 
# If you are seeing problems with pages not properly loading, disabling this option could work around the
# problem.

# Enabling this option significantly increases the number of connections that are reused, provided the
# keep-alive-timeout option is also enabled.
#
# Enabling this option is therefore only recommended if the connection-sharing option is disabled.

# This option has no effect if Privoxy has been compiled without keep-alive support.
